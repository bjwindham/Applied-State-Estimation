# Applied State Estimation

## About
Repository of code generated while studying applied state estimation from RJ Labbe's "Kalman and Bayesian Filters in Python" and "Estimation with Applications to Tracking and Navigation" by Bar-Shalom, Li, and Kirubarajan. As I progress through, I'll upload code that's been used to generate plots fo my reports, and used for learning purposes.

## File descriptions
In this section, as I upload new scripts, I'll provide a very brief description of what each script is/what it's used for, and the python dependencies to run it.
